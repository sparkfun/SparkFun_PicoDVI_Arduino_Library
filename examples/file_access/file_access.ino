This example shows how to use PicoDVI and a board's flash filesystem (i.e.
CIRCUITPY drive) simultaneously. This can be useful for loading graphics
files, saving game state in emulators, etc. To keep this simple, it's just
a mash-up of the existing PicoDVI '1bit_text' and Adafruit_CPFS 'simple'
examples, but the same principles certainly apply to other modes.

To start, you first need to temporarily install CircuitPython on the board
to initialize the flash filesystem, which can then be loaded up with the
files you need. https://circuitpython.org/downloads
With the filesystem prepared, one can then work with the Arduino code...

SUPER IMPORTANT: you MUST have current versions of several libraries and
the Earle Philhower arduino-pico core installed. Failure to have all the
right pieces will wipe out any data stored on the drive!

arduino-pico (via Arduino board manager)  3.3.0 or later
Adafruit_CPFS (via Library manager)       1.1.0 or later
Adafruit_SPIFlash (")                     4.2.0 or later

It is wise and STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to keep a backup of any data you install
on the board. These libraries combined are asking a LOT of the RP2040 chip,
and despite best efforts there's still the occasional hiccup that can wipe
the filesystem, making you start over with the CircuitPython install and
drive setup. See notes below about perhaps adding a boot switch to USB-mount
CIRCUITPY only when needed; it's more stable if left unmounted.
