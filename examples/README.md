# Arduino Examples for PicoDVI Library

This directory does not exist in the original PicoDVI repository.
It contains examples compatible with the Arduino IDE.

## Note

The examples in this directory are ported over from the Adafruit fork of the Pico DVI library. The only changes made were to use the SparkFun IoT RedBoard - RP2350 configuration structure in setup.
